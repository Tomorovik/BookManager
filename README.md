# BookManager

Application created for own use, to make it easier to organize my e-book collection and get grasp on MVVM pattern using MVVM Light. I've used also MaterialDesignThemes Nuget to make the UI little bit prettier.

* Working things:
    - Listing drives
    - File explorer
    - Renaming files
    - Deleting files
    - Creating new folder
    - Setting e-book library
    - Deletion of duplicated e-books
    - Moving found e-book to chosen folder
* Things to add in future:
    - Separated window for better organize library
    - Make categories for books and implement auto-categorizing books
    - Implement better hash algoritm
    - Put more extensions for e-books
